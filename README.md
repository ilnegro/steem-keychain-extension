# Steem Keychain App

Secure Steem Wallet App.

Steem Keychain App is for accessing Steem-enabled distributed applications, or "dApps" in your browser!

Steem Keychain App also lets the user create and manage their own identities, so when a dApp wants to perform a transaction and write to the blockchain, the user gets a secure interface to review the transaction, before approving or rejecting it.
