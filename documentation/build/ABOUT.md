Putting private keys directly into websites is not safe or secure, even ones run by reputable community members. Yet this is currently how nearly every Steem-based site or service currently works. On top of that, most Steem users likely use their master password which is even worse.

The Vessel desktop wallet software is a secure alternative, but it is too difficult to use for the majority of Steem users and does not easily interact with websites - which is Steem's primary use case.

On Ethereum, you never have to enter your private key into a website to use a dApp. You can just use a browser extension like Metamask, which dApp websites can interface with to securely store your keys and broadcast transactions to the blockchain.

Steem Keychain aims to bring the security and ease-of-use of Metamask to the Steem blockchain platform.
